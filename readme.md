This is for learning!

- [pigeon-maps](https://github.com/mariusandra/pigeon-maps)


## Implementation

My goal for this project is cover some topics of modern web development in React, which are:

- Import packages. âœ…
- Deal with interop when packages have a lot of that. âœ…
- Use Hooks and make hooks. âœ…
- Use js/DOM functions like localStorage and use their methods. âœ… 
- Use styled-components ðŸš§
- Use modularization
- Consume an API

Note: If you think there is a topic I should include, please open a issue.
